Project - Living in Victoria, Living Safe

## Background
We created an interactive visualisation of crime in each area of Victoria to assist in deciding the safest areas to live in. 
* Victoria has some of the fastest growing Local Government Area (LGA) populations in Australia.
* More 4.5 million people call Victoria home.
* Victorias population grows around 20-150K people each year.

Each area of Victoria is split into Local Government Areas (LGAs) where a cloropleth map is created. The crime amount for each LGA is shown in a diferent colour determined bythe crime colour scale where higher crime LGAs can be easily visualised. By also clicking on the LGA area, all suburbs and types of crimes are also shown in a popup. A time slider plugin for leaflet was added to the visualisation to show all the crimes from each year from 2010-2020.

We strongly believe this app will assist people moving or living in Victoria to find a safe place to live.

## Data

### Data source
* [Victorian Crime Data](https://discover.data.vic.gov.au/dataset/crime-by-location-data-table)
* [Suburb locality boundary](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-af33dd8c-0534-4e18-9245-fc64440f742e/details)
* [Victorian Local Government Area Boundaries](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-dga-bdf92691-c6fe-42b9-a0e2-a4cd716fa811/details)

### Data size and store
* The total document ammount of our data is 28295.
* The whole data is save in mongodb atlas cluster.

## Deploy enviorment

This app is deployed on heroku.

## Backend

The backend has 4 routes for rendering the html pages and 7 routes for API functions to return the required data.
The key for mongodb server and api are stored on heroku and retrieved by flask file.

### API functions
* Route /api/v3.0/all: return all the crime data for each suburb/year.
* Route /api/v3.0/lga/all: return all  the crime for each local government area/year.
* Route /api/v3.0/region/all: return all  the crime for each region/year.
* Route /api/v3.0/vic/all: return all  the crime for each year in victoria.
* Route /api/v3.0/lga/all_suburb: return the suburb list of each local government area.
* Route /api/v3.0/all_type: return the crime division/subdivision name and code.
* Route /api/v3.0/crime_data: return the filtered data depending on the input parameters. For example, request https://vic-crime.herokuapp.com/api/v3.0/crime_data?suburb=melbourne&year=2011&year=2020&off_field=subdiv will retrun the crime data (exclude the data of crime subdivisions) of melbourne suburb in year 2011 and year 2020.

## Web frontend

The vic-crime website has 4 pages, including the home page, data source page, visulisation page and table page

### Geomap visualisation
